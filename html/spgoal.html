            <h2>Cherish our natural resources</h2>
            <p>
              We believe that it is our duty to conserve natural resources for
              the future. Starting with conscious consumption, we have ceased
              using bottled water at events to reduce plastic waste on campus.
              In 2023, we will install photo-voltaic panels across campus to
              harness renewable clean energy.

            <h2>Spreading joy through green spaces</h2>
            <p>
              We believe in creating environments that support people
              physically, emotionally and culturally—to enhance the overall
              mental health and well-being of our community. In a bid to design
              more liveable spaces, we have installed smart sensors that track
              indoor air quality and human traffic to keep our surroundings
              comfy and occupants happy.

            <h2>Nurture stewards of the environment</h2>
            <p>
              It is our mission, as a polytechnic for all ages, to prepare our
              learners to be life-ready, work-ready and world-ready for the
              transformation of Singapore. By incorporating modules on
              sustainability into our curriculum, we hope to sow the seeds that
              will grow into future stewards of the environment. <br />SP
              students are introduced to the SG Green Plan and the United
              Nations' Sustainable Development Goals through our Common Core
              Curriculum. We also offer sustainability-related modules in our
              full-time diplomas and Continuing Education and Training
              programmes.

            <p>
              Taking a stroll along one of SP's many footpaths, you would find
              yourself immersed in greenery and nature—promoting relaxation,
              reducing stress and anxiety, and providing an instant mood boost.
              <br />When the foundation stone of our beautiful campus was laid,
              we have sought to integrate our buildings with its natural
              surroundings rather than replace them. We have also documented 230
              species of flora on campus including our majestic Brown Woolly Fig
              Heritage Trees found near Food Court 1.

            <p>
              Our journey towards a more sustainable future starts from within.
              The SP Environment Club is a student club that aims to drive
              environmental consciousness throughout campus with a variety of
              campaigns, competitions and social media content.

            <h2>Harness green partnerships for our future</h2>
            <p>
              We believe in the importance of working together to push the green
              agenda forward. Our partnerships, with industry leaders such as
              Grundfos, Danfoss and Singapore Green Building Council, go beyond
              developing sustainable solutions for local industries. We
              continually strive to upskill the Singapore workforce on
              sustainable business practices. <br />One such project involves
              partnering Samwoh, a leading integrated construction company, to
              develop a sustainable solution for our roads and pavements by
              using recycled plastic to create a more durable surface.
